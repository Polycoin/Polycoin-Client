Polycoin

Polycoin is inspired by Bitcoin but emphasizes

usability
security
simplicity
Polycoin Improves on Bitcoin in several ways

easy to use wallet designed for the mainstream
15 second transactions. Polycoin transactions are forty times faster than Bitcoin
better name and branding
clean, easy to use API for merchants and developers
increased transaction privacy
native support for off-block chain transactions for instant payments at point-of-sale
Security Improvements:

immunity from the Transaction Malleability attack
immunity to the 51% attack
ECDSA signature compression support for smaller/faster transactions
no hash collisions or duplicate coinbase outputs
HTTPS encryption
Polycoin is the most secure and most usable cryptocoin that has ever been designed.

No Mining

Satoshi has stated that mining is Bitcoin's only flaw. Miners are the greatest threat to Bitcoin's survival. Mining introduces social factors and greed into the survivability of Bitcoin as a currency.

Problems with Mining:

Dishonest miners are the greatest threat to Bitcoin
Bitcoin puts honest miners at a disadvantage to the mining cartels
cex.io allows people to rent a 51% attack by the minute
gigahash.io has abused its hashing power to steal Bitcoin from gambling sites
pools have begun capping block size to drive up transaction fees
Every month mining power is concentrated in the hands of fewer people
the costs of mining are passed on to every Bitcoin holder
mining pools can form cartels to orphan blocks by honest miners
mining cartels can rent capacity to orphan blocks from other pools
Mining ensures majority of new crypto-coins go to people with botnets, GPU farms and ASICs not available to the public
miners and electricity companies profit. Everyone else pays the costs.
block rewards create incentive to sybil attack network and influence block propagation. These attacks have slowed down blockchain downloads to unacceptable levels.
electricity used by mining is wasted
Mining increases transaction fees to unsustainable levels when block rewards decrease. Satoshi has stated that this will make Bitcoin unusable for microtransactions.
Miners driving up transaction fees will make Bitcoin transaction fees higher than the banking system Bitcoin was created to replace.
rapid changes in hash rate and mining profitability introduce unnecessary price volatility into Bitcoin. Price volatility caused by mining discourages Merchants from transacting in Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin reaches viability as the next global reserve currency, the incentives for nation states to monopolize and control mining are too great.
Miners sell Bitcoins to pay equipment and electricity costs, driving down the price of Bitcoin. Every Bitcoin holder pays the cost of mining.
Polycoin was designed to eliminate mining completely and eliminate the problems it creates

Polycoin replaces reliance on miners with reliance on mathematics
Polycoin is more secure because it does not rely upon the good will of miners
Polycoin transactions will be cheaper because there are no mining costs passed on to users
Polycoin transactions are not subject to 51% attacks by mining cartels
Polycoin is environmentally friendly and sustainable. Polycoin does not require twelve coal power plants to power mining
